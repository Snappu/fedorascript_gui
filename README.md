# How to use?
To get started, download the files and unpack where you need, [download the script](https://github.com/Bunnysword/Fedoscript/blob/main/config.conf) and drop it into the folder with the files of the graphical installer, then open the start.desktop file (if you can't do it, then give the coloring not done), then click start and enter the super user password in the console and wait.
